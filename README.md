Simple but handy tool for designing circuits and developing embedded systems

This tool simplifies easy but repetitive calculations in designing circuits and developing microcontroller firmware. 

In this version, you can calculate the Schmitt trigger resistors (suggests E12 and E24 standards values) and the ADC values (digital and voltage values).
