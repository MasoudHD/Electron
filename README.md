Simple but handy tool for designing circuits and developing embedded systems

This tool simplifies easy but repetitive calculations in designing circuits and developing microcontroller firmware. 

In this version you can:
1. Calculate the Schmitt trigger resistors (suggests E12 and E24 standards values)
2. Calculate the ADC values (digital and voltage values)
3. Calculate the coefficients of a polynomial equation by inserting the x and y values. You also can see the results on a graph and copy the array of coefficients for C language.
4. Calculate the possible settings for timers to set a desired time
